            <h3>Nutrition</h3>
            <p>Provide a balanced diet appropriate for their age, size, and breed. High-quality dog food, either dry or wet (or a combination), is essential. Fresh water should always be available.</p>

            <h3>Grooming</h3>
            <p>Regularly brush your dog's coat to reduce shedding and prevent matting. Bathe them as needed and trim their nails and clean their ears gently.</p>

            <h3>Exercise</h3>
            <p>Provide daily exercise opportunities tailored to your dog's energy level and breed. This may include walks, runs, playtime, or training activities.</p>

            <h3>Veterinary Care</h3>
            <p>Schedule regular check-ups with a veterinarian and keep up with vaccinations, flea, and tick prevention. Address any health concerns promptly.</p>

            <h3>Training</h3>
            <p>Train your dog with positive reinforcement methods to encourage good behavior and obedience. Socialize them with other dogs and people from a young age.</p>

            <h3>Environment</h3>
            <p>Create a safe and comfortable environment at home. Provide a designated sleeping area and secure any hazards or toxic substances.</p>

            <h3>Affection and Attention</h3>
            <p>Dogs are social animals and need companionship. Spend quality time with your dog, provide mental stimulation, and interact with them through play and affection.</p>

            <h3>Safety</h3>
            <p>Ensure your dog is safe outdoors with a secure fence or leash. Monitor them for signs of heatstroke, especially in hot weather, and protect them from extreme temperatures.</p>
