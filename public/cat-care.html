        <h2>Cat Care</h2>
        <p>General instructions on how to care for a cat.</p>
        <div class="care-instructions">
            <h3>Nutrition</h3>
            <p>Provide a balanced diet appropriate for their age and health status. High-quality cat food, either dry or wet (or a combination), is essential. Fresh water should always be available.</p>

            <h3>Grooming</h3>
            <p>Regularly brush your cat to reduce shedding and prevent matting, especially for long-haired breeds. Trim their nails as needed and clean their ears and eyes gently.</p>

            <h3>Litter Box</h3>
            <p>Keep the litter box clean and accessible. Cats are clean animals and prefer a clean environment for their bathroom needs.</p>

            <h3>Exercise</h3>
            <p>Provide opportunities for play and exercise. Cats enjoy toys that mimic hunting behaviors, such as feather wands or small balls. Playtime helps keep them mentally and physically stimulated.</p>

            <h3>Veterinary Care</h3>
            <p>Schedule regular check-ups with a veterinarian and keep up with vaccinations, flea, and tick prevention. Promptly address any health concerns or behavioral changes.</p>

            <h3>Environment</h3>
            <p>Create a safe and stimulating environment at home. Cats need places to climb, scratch (provide scratching posts), hide, and rest comfortably.</p>

            <h3>Affection and Attention</h3>
            <p>Cats thrive on companionship and affection. Spend quality time with your cat daily, petting and interacting with them based on their preferences.</p>

            <h3>Monitoring Behavior</h3>
            <p>Watch for changes in behavior, appetite, litter box habits, and overall demeanor. Cats can hide signs of illness, so any unusual behavior should be checked by a vet.</p>

            <h3>Safety</h3>
            <p>Ensure your home is safe for your cat. Remove any hazards like toxic plants, chemicals, or small objects they could swallow.</p>
